Available endpointsÂ¶
If you wish to call the REST API manually via another route, e.g. directly via curl, the table below shows the relevant URL endpoints and parameters. All endpoints in the below table need to be prefixed with the base URL of the API, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/ - so the command becomes http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/<command>.
